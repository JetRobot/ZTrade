Part C: Asset
Developer: Yann
Validator: Jospeh




Requirements
------------
underlying asset class - could bear all the info on yc, vol sf, etc, so we only pass assets in parameters in the derivatives - not the choice we made so very basic and unused class - except for getting long a stock

Design 
------

* Approach
no big deal

* Choices


* Methods

a virtual getPrice so that of later we want to inherit we can do it

* Unit tests
div

* Performance


Validation
----------

* Approach

<i.e. what alternate method was used to validate the results - if this required a lot of code then similar outline as above should apply>

* Pitfalls

<i.e. what bugs were found>
