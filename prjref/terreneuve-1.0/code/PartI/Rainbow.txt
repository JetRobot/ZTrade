Part I: Rainbow Options
Developer: Yann
Validator: ????



Requirements
------------
see website for formulas + correction
also, spread and basket options dont have a closed form solution (rubinstein 95)

New products

Graphs, Sobol/ Mersenne,

Per Strike - only closed forms


Design 
------

* Approach
<high-level description of the design>

* Choices
More than 2 assets is possible (using cholesky decomposition to recorrelate the samples.
Supposed non path dependant Rainbom : no need of a YC/VolSf per asset, just a single rate to maturity (no quanto: each of them have same RF rate) and a volToMaturity for each one.
not considered dividends, but would be an easy amendment (to drift first...)


* Methods
Had to amend to Drift/Gaussian/Random/MCEngine/Payoff to adapt more easily to non path dependant payoffs and avoid passing valarray<valarray>

* Unit tests

greeks suck in closed form

* Performance

<how can the performance of this component be sped up by 100%?>
