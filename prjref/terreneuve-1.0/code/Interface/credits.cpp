	cout<<"- Aloke Mukherjee"<<endl;
	cout<<"- Joseph Perez"<<endl;
	cout<<"- Yann Renoux\n"<<endl;

	cout<<"We would like to thank our parents, our grand parents, and ... wait a minute,"<<endl;
	cout<<"are we supposed to make this a serious page ? \n"<<endl;

	cout<<"OK now the real (and egocentric) thanks:"<<endl;
	cout<<"- Simon, Joseph and Yann would like to thank Aloke for bearing with us during"<<endl;
	cout<<"our discussions in French. And also for his unrealistic but true laughter!"<<endl;
	cout<<"- Aloke, Joseph and Yann would like to thank Simon for his idea of putting a"<<endl;
	cout<<"naked babe in the credits (now you want to read our code to see where we hid it!)."<<endl;
	cout<<"- Simon, Aloke and Joseph would like to thank Yann for the 10,000 emails he "<<endl;
	cout<<"sent while commiting his versions of the code every 5 minutes..."<<endl;
	cout<<"- Simon, Aloke and Yann would like to thank Joseph for his idea to code an Excel"<<endl;
	cout<<"addin. When you have done it, give us a shout !"<<endl;
	cout<<"- Simon, Aloke, Joseph and Yann thank Tanya and Nandika (Aloke's wife and daughter) "<<endl;
	cout<<"for not killing Aloke for neglecting his family. It would have been a real headache "<<endl;
	cout<<"to dispose of his body.\n"<<endl;

	cout<<"We would also like to thank the Bagel Factory, the Starbucks Coffee, the Coca Cola"<<endl;
	cout<<"company and all the tasty greasy food we ate while coding until 4am.\n"<<endl;

	cout<<"Many thanks to the nerds that invented the Internet, we used it a lot.\n"<<endl;

	cout<<"We are also thankful to sourceforge.net for the user-friendly interface to share "<<endl;
	cout<<"code and use it with CVS, it helped a lot.\n"<<endl;

	cout<<"Last, but not least (I know this introduction is easy but I like it and I am the "<<endl;
	cout<<"coder so if I want to write it I write it!), we would like to thank Kishor Laud"<<endl;
	cout<<"for all the answers he provided during the development of this project, and all"<<endl;
	cout<<"our classmates for asking so many questions that Kishor often answered the ones we"<<endl;
	cout<<"would ask ourselves even before we thought about them.\n\n"<<endl;
